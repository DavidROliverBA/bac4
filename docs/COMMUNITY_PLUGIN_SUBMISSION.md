# Obsidian Community Plugin Submission Checklist

This document outlines all requirements and steps for submitting BAC4 to the Obsidian Community Plugins directory.

## ✅ Pre-Submission Checklist

### 1. Repository Requirements

#### ✅ Repository Name
- **Current:** `bac4`
- **Status:** ✅ **CORRECT** - Matches plugin ID in manifest.json
- **Action:** None required

#### ✅ Repository Visibility
- **Required:** Public repository
- **Status:** ✅ Public
- **Action:** None required

#### ✅ Required Files in Root

**manifest.json** ✅
```json
{
  "id": "bac4",
  "name": "BAC4 - Cloud Architecture Management",
  "version": "0.8.0",
  "minAppVersion": "1.0.0",
  "description": "AI-native cloud architecture management with C4 model diagrams...",
  "author": "David Oliver",
  "authorUrl": "https://github.com/DavidROliverBA",
  "isDesktopOnly": true
}
```

**versions.json** ✅
```json
{
  "0.8.0": "1.0.0",
  ...
}
```

**LICENSE** ✅
- MIT License present
- Compatible with Obsidian's requirements

**README.md** ✅
- Comprehensive documentation
- Installation instructions
- Features list
- Screenshots/GIFs (recommended - add if missing)

#### ⚠️ Files to Add/Check

**styles.css** (Optional but recommended)
- Currently missing - not critical but good to have
- Can be empty if no custom styles needed outside React components

---

### 2. Manifest.json Requirements

#### ✅ Current Status - COMPLIANT

All required fields present:
- ✅ `id`: "bac4" (matches repo name)
- ✅ `name`: "BAC4 - Cloud Architecture Management" (descriptive, unique)
- ✅ `version`: "0.8.0" (semantic versioning)
- ✅ `minAppVersion`: "1.0.0" (Obsidian minimum version)
- ✅ `description`: Complete, under 250 characters ✅ (182 chars)
- ✅ `author`: "David Oliver"
- ✅ `authorUrl`: Valid GitHub profile URL
- ✅ `isDesktopOnly`: true (correct for React/heavy UI)

#### Optional Fields to Consider Adding

```json
{
  "fundingUrl": "https://github.com/sponsors/YourUsername"
}
```

---

### 3. Versions.json Requirements

#### ✅ Current Status - COMPLIANT

Format: `{ "plugin-version": "min-obsidian-version" }`

Current versions.json correctly maps all releases to minimum Obsidian version 1.0.0.

**Action:** Update this file whenever you release a new version.

---

### 4. Build Requirements

#### ✅ Current Status - COMPLIANT

- ✅ `main.js` produced by build (730KB)
- ✅ No external dependencies in runtime (React bundled)
- ✅ Uses esbuild for bundling
- ✅ No Node.js modules accessed at runtime

#### ⚠️ Potential Issue: Bundle Size

**Current:** 730KB (quite large!)

**Obsidian Recommendation:** Keep plugin under 500KB if possible

**Options to reduce:**
1. **Code splitting** - Load React Flow only when canvas opens
2. **Remove unused code** - Tree shaking optimization
3. **Compress assets** - Minify further
4. **Lazy load components** - Dynamic imports

**Priority:** LOW - Large bundle is acceptable if plugin provides value

---

### 5. Code Quality Requirements

#### ✅ Tests
- ✅ 104 tests passing
- ✅ 29.65% coverage
- ✅ Jest + ts-jest setup

#### ✅ TypeScript
- ✅ Strict mode enabled
- ✅ No `any` types (minimal use)
- ✅ Type checking passes

#### ✅ Code Standards
- ✅ ESLint configured
- ✅ Prettier formatting
- ✅ No security vulnerabilities

---

### 6. Security & Privacy Requirements

#### ✅ Network Requests

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Anthropic API calls (optional feature, user must provide API key)
- ✅ No telemetry or tracking
- ✅ No data sent without user consent
- ✅ API key stored securely in Obsidian settings

**Obsidian Requirement:**
- Network requests must be disclosed in README ✅
- User must explicitly enable network features ✅
- No tracking or analytics ✅

#### ✅ Data Storage

- ✅ All data stored locally in vault
- ✅ No external database connections
- ✅ No cloud sync required
- ✅ Git-native JSON files

---

### 7. Documentation Requirements

#### ✅ README.md Must Include:

- ✅ Clear description of plugin functionality
- ✅ Installation instructions
- ✅ Usage guide with examples
- ✅ Features list
- ✅ Troubleshooting section (add if missing)
- ⚠️ **Screenshots/GIFs** (RECOMMENDED - add if missing!)
- ✅ License information
- ✅ Links to documentation

#### 📸 Action Item: Add Screenshots

Create and add to README.md:
1. **Canvas editor** - Full diagram view
2. **Component palette** - Drag & drop UI
3. **Property panel** - Node editing
4. **AI generation modal** - Description input
5. **Hierarchical navigation** - Multi-level diagrams

Save as: `docs/images/` folder, reference in README.

---

### 8. GitHub Release Requirements

#### ✅ Automated Release Workflow

**Status:** ✅ Created `.github/workflows/release.yml`

**How it works:**
1. Push a git tag: `git tag -a 1.0.0 -m "Release 1.0.0"`
2. Push tag: `git push origin 1.0.0`
3. GitHub Actions automatically:
   - Builds the plugin
   - Creates a release
   - Uploads `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `.zip` file

#### 📋 Manual Release Checklist (if not using automation):

1. Update `manifest.json` version
2. Update `versions.json` with new version
3. Update `package.json` version
4. Run `npm run build`
5. Create GitHub release with tag matching version
6. Upload these files to release:
   - `main.js` (required)
   - `manifest.json` (required)
   - `styles.css` (if present)
