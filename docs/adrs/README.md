# Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) for the BAC4 Plugin. ADRs document significant architectural decisions, their context, alternatives considered, and consequences.

## What is an ADR?

An ADR is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. ADRs help:
- Document the "why" behind architectural choices
- Provide context for future maintainers
- Enable informed decision-making
- Prevent revisiting settled decisions

---

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows this structure:
- **Title:** Short, descriptive name (e.g., "Use React Flow for Canvas")
- **Status:** Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded
- **Context:** What problem are we solving?
- **Decision:** What did we decide?
- **Alternatives:** What else did we consider?
- **Rationale:** Why this decision?
- **Consequences:** Positive, negative, and neutral outcomes

## Decision Process

### When to Create an ADR

Create an ADR when:
- Making a decision that affects multiple components
- Choosing between multiple viable alternatives
- Making a decision that is difficult or expensive to reverse
- Addressing a significant architectural concern
- Answering a recurring question about architecture

### When NOT to Create an ADR

Don't create an ADR for:
- Trivial decisions (variable naming, simple refactoring)
- Decisions that are easily reversible
- Implementation details within a single component
- Temporary/experimental code

### ADR Workflow

1. **Identify Need:** Recognize an architectural decision point
2. **Research Alternatives:** Investigate multiple approaches
3. **Draft ADR:** Write ADR with context, alternatives, and recommendation
4. **Review:** Share with team for feedback (via PR)
5. **Decide:** Team agrees on decision (or revises ADR)
6. **Accept:** Merge ADR with status "Accepted"
7. **Implement:** Build according to ADR
8. **Update:** If decision changes, create superseding ADR

## ADR Template

```markdown
# ADR XXX: [Short Title]

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Status:** Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded by ADR-YYY
**Deciders:** [List of people involved]
**Related:** [Related ADRs, issues, docs]

---

## Context

What is the issue/problem we're facing?
What constraints exist?
Why does this matter?

## Decision

What did we decide?
Be clear and specific.

## Alternatives Considered

### Option 1
- Pros:
- Cons:

### Option 2
- Pros:
- Cons:

## Rationale

Why did we choose this option?
What factors were most important?

## Consequences

### Positive
- What benefits do we gain?

### Negative
- What downsides do we accept?

### Neutral
- What other impacts exist?

## Implementation Details

How will this be implemented?
What are the key integration points?

## References

Links to related documentation, code, or resources

## Revision History

| Date | Author | Changes |

## Reviewing ADRs

When reviewing an ADR:
- ✅ Check if context is clear and complete
- ✅ Verify all reasonable alternatives are considered
- ✅ Ensure rationale explains the "why"
- ✅ Look for potential negative consequences
- ✅ Check if implementation details are sufficient
- ✅ Verify decision aligns with project goals

---

## Superseding ADRs

When an architectural decision changes:
1. Create NEW ADR (don't modify existing)
2. Mark old ADR as "Superseded by ADR-XXX"
3. Explain why decision changed in new ADR
4. Reference old ADR in new one

**Example:**
```markdown
# ADR 005: Use Azure Cosmos DB Instead of Local JSON

**Status:** Accepted
**Supersedes:** [ADR 002](./002-centralized-relationships-file.md)

## Context

Since ADR 002 was accepted, we've added cloud sync...
[Explain what changed and why]
```
