### Trade-offs Accepted

**❌ No OWM import initially**
- Mitigation: Add in Phase 3 (Q3 2026)
- Most users will create maps in BAC4 anyway

**❌ Learning curve for OWM users**
- Mitigation: Visual editor is more intuitive than text syntax
- OWM export allows sharing with community

**❌ Development effort (40-60 hours)**
- Mitigation: Phased rollout spreads effort over 3 quarters
- Core features in Phase 1 (20-25 hours) deliver 80% value
