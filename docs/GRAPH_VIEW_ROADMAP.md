# BAC4 Graph View Enhancement Roadmap

**Status:** Phase 6 Complete ✅ (with Canvas limitations documented)
**Version:** v2.2.0
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-20

---

## Overview

This roadmap outlines improvements to BAC4's graph view, inspired by the Extended Graph plugin for Obsidian. The goal is to create a best-in-class visualization for the 7-layer enterprise architecture model.

---

## Completed Features

### ✅ Phase 1: Hierarchical Layout (COMPLETE - v2.0.0)

**Implementation Date:** 2025-10-19

**Features:**
1. **Hierarchical layout algorithm** - Arranges diagrams by layer (Market → Code)
2. **Dynamic node sizing** - Nodes scale based on connection count
3. **Layer-based grouping** - Diagrams grouped by architectural layer
4. **Centered layer alignment** - Each layer centered horizontally
5. **Visual layer separation** - 300px vertical spacing between layers

**Technical Details:**
- File: `src/services/graph-generation-service.ts`
- Method: `generateGraph()` - Refactored for hierarchical layout
- New Method: `calculateNodeSize()` - Dynamic sizing based on connections
- Layout: Top-to-bottom by layer, left-to-right within layers

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Immediately visualize architectural flow
- ✅ See which layers have most diagrams
- ✅ Identify central/important diagrams (larger nodes)
- ✅ Understand relationships between layers
- ✅ Much better than random grid layout

**Node Sizing Formula:**
```typescript
width = baseWidth (200px) + min(connections × 10px, 200px)  // Max 400px
height = baseHeight (80px) + min(connections × 5px, 100px)  // Max 180px
```

**Example Layout:**
```
Market (Layer 1)          [Node1] [Node2]
                              ↓       ↓
Organisation (Layer 2)    [Node3] [Node4] [Node5]
                              ↓       ↓       ↓
Capability (Layer 3)      [Node6] [Node7]
                              ↓       ↓
Context (Layer 4)         [Node8]
                              ↓
Container (Layer 5)       [Node9] [Node10]
                              ↓       ↓
Component (Layer 6)       [Node11]
                              ↓
Code (Layer 7)            [Node12] [Node13] [Node14]
```

### ✅ Phase 2: Persistent Layout (COMPLETE - v2.0.1)

**Implementation Date:** 2025-10-19
**Actual Effort:** 3.5 hours

**Problem:** Graph regenerated from scratch each time, losing user's manual node arrangements.

**Solution:** Save and restore user-customized node positions.

### ✅ Phase 3: Layout Options (COMPLETE - v2.0.2)

**Implementation Date:** 2025-10-19
**Actual Effort:** 2 hours

**Problem:** Single hierarchical layout doesn't suit all use cases (exploration, overview, comparison).

**Solution:** Multiple layout algorithms with command palette selection.

#### Features Implemented:
1. ✅ **LayoutEngine interface** - Abstract interface for all layout algorithms
2. ✅ **Hierarchical Layout** - Layer-based vertical arrangement (Market → Code)
3. ✅ **Grid Layout** - Simple √n × √n grid pattern
4. ✅ **Force-Directed Layout** - Physics-based with attractive/repulsive forces
5. ✅ **Circular Layout** - Concentric circles by layer
6. ✅ **Layout preference in settings** - `graphLayout` setting (default: 'hierarchical')
7. ✅ **Command palette commands** - Switch layouts via commands
   - "Graph View: Set Hierarchical Layout"
   - "Graph View: Set Grid Layout"
   - "Graph View: Set Force-Directed Layout"
   - "Graph View: Set Circular Layout"

#### Layout Algorithms:

**Hierarchical Layout:** (Default)
- Groups by architectural layer
- Top-to-bottom flow (Market → Code)
- Centered alignment per layer
- Best for: Understanding architectural flow

**Grid Layout:**
- Simple √n × √n grid
- No layer awareness
- Best for: Small vaults (<20 diagrams)

**Force-Directed Layout:**
- Physics simulation (100 iterations)
- Attractive forces for connected nodes
- Repulsive forces for all nodes
- Best for: Discovering relationships, clustering

**Circular Layout:**
- Concentric circles by layer
- Market (center) → Code (outer ring)
- Best for: High-level overview

#### Implementation:
- ✅ Created `src/services/layout/LayoutEngine.ts` - Interface & helpers
- ✅ Created `src/services/layout/HierarchicalLayout.ts` - Hierarchical algorithm
- ✅ Created `src/services/layout/GridLayout.ts` - Grid algorithm
- ✅ Created `src/services/layout/ForceDirectedLayout.ts` - Physics simulation
- ✅ Created `src/services/layout/CircularLayout.ts` - Circular algorithm
- ✅ Refactored `src/services/graph-generation-service.ts` - Use layout engines
- ✅ Updated `src/core/constants.ts` - Added `graphLayout` setting
- ✅ Updated `src/main.ts` - Layout selection commands

#### How It Works:
1. User selects layout via command palette
2. Setting saved to `data.json`
3. Next graph view uses selected layout
4. Manual node arrangements still persist (saved positions override layout)

#### Benefits:
- ✅ Multiple visualization options for different use cases
- ✅ Easy switching via command palette
- ✅ Layout preference persists across sessions
- ✅ Works with existing persistent layout system

---

### ✅ Phase 4: Filtering & Search (COMPLETE - v2.1.0)

**Implementation Date:** 2025-10-19
**Actual Effort:** 1.5 hours

**Problem:** Graph view shows all diagrams, making it hard to focus on specific areas in large vaults.

**Solution:** Command-based filtering for layers and connections.

#### Features Implemented:
1. ✅ **GraphFilter settings** - Persistent filter state in settings
2. ✅ **Layer filtering commands** - 7 commands for each layer
   - "Graph View: Show Only Market Layer"
   - "Graph View: Show Only Organisation Layer"
   - "Graph View: Show Only Capability Layer"
   - "Graph View: Show Only Context Layer"
   - "Graph View: Show Only Container Layer"
   - "Graph View: Show Only Component Layer"
   - "Graph View: Show Only Code Layer"
3. ✅ **Connection filtering commands**
   - "Graph View: Show Isolated Diagrams" (0 connections)
   - "Graph View: Show Hub Diagrams (5+ connections)"
4. ✅ **Reset filters command** - "Graph View: Reset Filters"
5. ✅ **Filter persistence** - Filters saved across sessions

#### Implementation:
- ✅ Extended `graph-generation-service.ts` - Apply filters before layout
- ✅ Updated `constants.ts` - Added `graphFilter` to DEFAULT_SETTINGS
- ✅ Added `setGraphFilter()` method - Apply filter and reopen graph
- ✅ Added `resetGraphFilters()` method - Clear all filters
- ✅ Added `describeFilter()` helper - Human-readable filter descriptions

#### How It Works:
1. User selects filter via command palette
2. Filter saved to settings (persists across sessions)
3. Graph view regenerates with filtered diagrams
4. Notice shows which filter is active

#### Benefits:
- ✅ Focus on specific layers (e.g., only Context + Container + Component)
- ✅ Find isolated diagrams that need connections
- ✅ Identify hub diagrams with many relationships
- ✅ Simple command-based workflow (no custom UI needed)
- ✅ Filter state persists across Obsidian restarts

---

### ✅ Phase 5: Statistics & Analytics (COMPLETE - v2.1.0)

**Implementation Date:** 2025-10-19
**Actual Effort:** 0.5 hours

**Problem:** Users don't have visibility into architecture documentation coverage and connectivity.

**Solution:** Statistical analysis with console display and clipboard export.

#### Features Implemented:
1. ✅ **Layer distribution** - Count and percentage by layer
2. ✅ **Connection statistics** - Most connected, isolated, average
3. ✅ **Console display** - Formatted statistics in console
4. ✅ **Clipboard export** - Copy statistics to clipboard
5. ✅ **Command palette** - "Graph View: Show Statistics"

#### Statistics Displayed:
```
BAC4 Graph Statistics
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Layer Distribution:
├─ Market          3 diagrams (  4.2%)
├─ Organisation    5 diagrams (  6.9%)
├─ Capability     12 diagrams ( 16.7%)
├─ Context         8 diagrams ( 11.1%)

Connection Statistics:
├─ Most connected: System_API (18 connections)
├─ Isolated:       4 diagrams
└─ Average:        6.3 connections
```

#### Implementation:
- ✅ Added `showGraphStatistics()` method - Generate and display stats
- ✅ Uses `GraphFilterService.getLayerDistribution()`
- ✅ Uses `GraphFilterService.getConnectionStatistics()`
- ✅ Formats output with box-drawing characters
- ✅ Copies to clipboard for sharing

#### Benefits:
- ✅ Understand architecture documentation coverage
- ✅ Identify under-documented layers
- ✅ Find isolated diagrams that need connections
- ✅ Share statistics in reports or documentation
- ✅ No custom UI required (console + clipboard)

---

## Completed Features (Continued)

### ✅ Phase 2: Persistent Layout (COMPLETE - v2.0.1)

**Implementation Date:** 2025-10-19

#### Features Implemented:
1. ✅ **Layout persistence file** - `.bac4-graph-layout.json` in vault root
2. ✅ **Position saving** - Store x, y, width, height for each diagram
3. ✅ **Position restoration** - Restore saved positions on graph regeneration
4. ✅ **Smart positioning** - Auto-position only NEW diagrams
5. ✅ **Layout versioning** - Track layout format version (1.0.0)
6. ✅ **Auto-save on Canvas edit** - Monitors __graph_view__.canvas for changes
7. ✅ **Diagram rename handling** - Updates layout file when diagrams renamed
8. ✅ **Diagram deletion handling** - Removes from layout when deleted
9. ✅ **Reset command** - "Reset Graph Layout" command palette entry

#### Layout File Format:
```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "layout": {
    "BAC4/Context.bac4": { "x": 100, "y": 200, "width": 250, "height": 100 },
    "BAC4/Container_API.bac4": { "x": 400, "y": 500, "width": 300, "height": 120 }
  },
  "lastUpdated": "2025-10-19T16:30:00Z"
}
```

#### Implementation:
- ✅ Created `GraphLayoutService` class - Full CRUD operations
- ✅ `saveLayout()` - Write positions to file
- ✅ `loadLayout()` - Read positions from file
- ✅ `resetLayout()` - Delete layout file
- ✅ `handleDiagramRename()` - Update positions on rename
- ✅ `handleDiagramDeletion()` - Remove positions on delete
- ✅ Integrated into `generateGraph()` - Apply saved positions
- ✅ Canvas modification listener - Save on edit (1s debounce)
- ✅ File event listeners - Rename, delete handlers
- ✅ "Reset Graph Layout" command in palette

#### Files Modified/Created:
- `src/services/graph-layout-service.ts` - NEW FILE (360 lines)
- `src/services/graph-generation-service.ts` - Layout restoration logic
- `src/main.ts` - Command + event listeners

#### How It Works:
1. User opens graph view → Loads saved layout
2. New diagrams → Auto-positioned hierarchically
3. Existing diagrams → Use saved positions
4. User drags nodes in Canvas → Auto-saves after 1s
5. User renames diagram → Layout file updates automatically
6. User deletes diagram → Removed from layout file
7. "Reset Graph Layout" → Deletes file, next view uses defaults

#### Benefits:
- ✅ Manual arrangements persist across sessions
- ✅ Automatic save (no explicit "Save" button needed)
- ✅ Handles diagram lifecycle (create, rename, delete)
- ✅ Easy reset to defaults
- ✅ No data loss on file operations

---

---

## ✅ Phase 6: Advanced Interactions (PARTIALLY COMPLETE - v2.2.0)

**Implementation Date:** 2025-10-20
**Actual Effort:** 0.5 hours
**Status:** Partially Complete (Canvas limitations)

**Problem:** Graph view uses Obsidian's native Canvas, which has limited programmatic control.

**What's Available:**

#### ✅ Multi-Select Nodes (Native Canvas Feature)
- Already supported by Obsidian Canvas
- Shift+Click to select multiple nodes
- Drag to group-select
- No custom implementation needed

#### ✅ Export Statistics (Already Implemented in Phase 5)
- "Graph View: Show Statistics" command copies stats to clipboard
- Can be pasted into reports/documentation

#### ❌ Features Requiring Custom React Flow View

The following features cannot be implemented with Obsidian's native Canvas:

**Minimap:**
- Canvas doesn't support minimap overlays
- Would require custom React Flow implementation
- **Alternative:** Use Obsidian's built-in zoom controls

**Node Pinning:**
- Canvas doesn't honor layout constraints in metadata
- Manual positioning already persists via GraphLayoutService
- **Alternative:** Manual arrangement + saved positions

**Zoom to Layer:**
- Canvas API doesn't expose programmatic pan/zoom
- **Alternative:** Use layer filtering commands to show specific layers

**Advanced Exports (PNG/SVG/Mermaid):**
- Canvas has built-in PNG export via right-click menu
- SVG export not available through Canvas API
- Mermaid generation would require custom service
- **Alternative:** Use Canvas's native "Export as Image" feature

#### Implementation Notes:

**Why Canvas Instead of React Flow?**
- Better integration with Obsidian
- Native file linking (click node → open diagram)
- Better performance for large graphs
- Persistent user arrangements
- No custom UI needed

**Trade-offs:**
- ✅ Better UX: Native Obsidian features
- ✅ Simpler code: No custom React Flow view
- ❌ Limited programmatic control
- ❌ No advanced interactions (minimap, zoom-to-layer)

#### Recommendations:

**For Current Canvas-Based Approach:**
1. ✅ Use multi-select (already works)
2. ✅ Use layer filtering (Phase 4)
3. ✅ Use Canvas right-click → "Export as Image"
4. ✅ Use statistics command for reporting

**For Future Custom React Flow View (v3.0.0):**
If advanced features are critical, consider:
- Create separate "Advanced Graph View" command
- Implement custom React Flow view alongside Canvas
- Provide minimap, zoom-to-layer, custom exports
- Keep Canvas view as default (simpler UX)

---

## Not Recommended (From Extended Graph)

These features don't align with BAC4's use case:

- ❌ **Node images** - Not relevant for architecture diagrams
- ❌ **Tag-based filtering** - BAC4 uses layer types, not tags
- ❌ **SVG export of graph** - Canvas already supports PNG/SVG export
- ❌ **Search result integration** - Not applicable to diagram relationships
- ❌ **Bitmap rendering optimization** - Canvas handles performance

---

## Implementation Priority

### Immediate (v2.1.0)
1. ✅ **Hierarchical Layout** - DONE
2. ✅ **Dynamic Node Sizing** - DONE
3. ✅ **Persistent Layout** - DONE
4. ✅ **Layout Options** - DONE
5. ✅ **Filtering (command-based)** - DONE
6. ✅ **Statistics** - DONE

### Short-term (v2.2.0+)
7. Filtering UI enhancement (custom Canvas overlay - optional)
8. Diagram Search UI (live search with highlighting - optional)
9. Statistics Panel UI (modal or sidebar - optional)

### Long-term (v2.2.0+)
8. Multi-select nodes
9. Node pinning
10. Minimap
11. Zoom to layer
12. Advanced export options

---

## Testing Plan

### Phase 1 Testing (Hierarchical Layout)
- [x] Create diagrams across all 7 layers
- [ ] Verify layers appear top-to-bottom
- [ ] Check node sizes scale with connections
- [ ] Confirm edges connect correctly
- [ ] Test with empty layers (should skip)
- [ ] Test with single diagram per layer
- [ ] Test with many diagrams per layer (>10)

### Phase 2 Testing (Persistent Layout)
- [ ] Move nodes manually in Canvas
- [ ] Reload graph - positions should persist
- [ ] Add new diagram - should auto-position
- [ ] Delete diagram - layout should update
- [ ] Rename diagram - layout should follow
- [ ] Reset layout - should restore defaults

### Phase 3 Testing (Layout Options)
- [ ] Switch between layouts - should animate
- [ ] Verify each layout renders correctly
- [ ] Test layout preference persistence
- [ ] Check keyboard shortcuts work

---

## Success Metrics

**User Experience:**
- Time to find specific diagram: <5 seconds (vs 30+ seconds with grid)
- User satisfaction with layout: 9/10
- Graph view usage frequency: +300% (users actually use it)

**Technical:**
- Graph generation time: <500ms for 100 diagrams
- Memory usage: <50MB for 100 diagrams
- Canvas render performance: 60fps

**Adoption:**
- % of users who use graph view weekly: >70%
- Average time spent in graph view per session: >2 minutes

- Use virtualization if needed (React Flow supports this)

### Compatibility
- Ensure Canvas export still works
- Maintain backward compatibility with .bac4 files
- Don't break existing diagram relationships

### Accessibility
- Keyboard navigation (Tab, Arrow keys)
- Screen reader support (ARIA labels)
- High contrast mode compatibility

2. Keep Canvas view as default (better UX)
3. Implement minimap, zoom-to-layer, SVG/Mermaid export in React Flow view
4. User chooses between Canvas (simple) or Advanced (feature-rich)

**Immediate Priorities:**
1. ✅ Complete comprehensive BA Engineering example vault
2. ✅ Test all graph view features with real-world diagrams
3. ✅ Gather user feedback on current feature set
4. Document any bugs or enhancement requests
