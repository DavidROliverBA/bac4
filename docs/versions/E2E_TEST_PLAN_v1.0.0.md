## Phase 1: Timeline Initialization & Basic Operations

### Test 1.1: Create New Diagram with Timeline
**Objective:** Verify that new diagrams automatically get a timeline with an initial snapshot.

**Steps:**
1. Create a new file: `Timeline-Tests/Test1-Context.bac4`
2. Open the file in BAC4 view
3. Add 2-3 System nodes
4. Add 1 Person node
5. Connect them with edges
6. Wait 1 second (auto-save debounce)

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Diagram opens with empty canvas
- [ ] Timeline toolbar is NOT visible (only 1 snapshot exists)
- [ ] Auto-save occurs (check console for "Auto-saved v1.0.0")
- [ ] File contains timeline with 1 snapshot labeled "Current"

**Verification:**
```bash
# Check file structure
cat Timeline-Tests/Test1-Context.bac4 | jq '.timeline'
```
Should show:
```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "snapshots": [
    {
      "id": "snapshot-...",
      "label": "Current",
      "timestamp": null,
      "description": null,
      "createdAt": "...",
      "nodes": [...],
      "edges": [...],
      "annotations": []

   - Color: Blue ‚Üí Red
4. Wait 1 second for auto-save
5. Switch to snapshot 1 (‚Üê Previous)
6. Switch back to snapshot 2 (Next ‚Üí)
7. Verify the changed node

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Node has a blue badge: "MODIFIED"

2. Open the same file in a NEW tab (Cmd+Click on file)
3. Observe both tabs

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Tab 1 shows background dots
- [ ] Tab 2 shows background dots
- [ ] BOTH tabs maintain dots simultaneously (no conflict)
- [ ] Arrows on edges visible in both tabs
- [ ] No console errors about SVG patterns

**Background:** This was a critical bug in v0.8.0 where opening multiple tabs caused the first tab to lose background rendering due to SVG ID conflicts.

---

### Test 7.2: Large Timeline (10+ Snapshots)
**Objective:** Verify performance with many snapshots.

**Steps:**
1. Create a new diagram
2. Add 15 snapshots via scripted approach or manually:
   - Snapshot 1: "Week 1"
   - Snapshot 2: "Week 2"
   - ... (continue to Week 15)
3. Navigate through all snapshots using Previous/Next
4. Open Snapshot Manager

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Timeline dropdown shows all 15 snapshots (scrollable)
- [ ] Navigation buttons work smoothly
- [ ] Snapshot Manager lists all 15 (scrollable)
- [ ] No performance degradation
- [ ] File size reasonable (< 500kb for moderate diagram)

---

### Test 7.3: Complex Change Detection
**Objective:** Verify change detection with many modifications.

**Steps:**
1. Create snapshot 1 with 10 nodes
2. Create snapshot 2 with:
   - 3 new nodes (should show NEW)
   - 2 deleted nodes (should not appear)
   - 3 modified nodes (changed labels/colors, should show MODIFIED)
   - 2 unchanged nodes (no badge)
3. Enable "Show Changes"

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] 3 nodes badged "NEW" (green)
- [ ] 3 nodes badged "MODIFIED" (blue)
- [ ] 2 nodes have no badge (unchanged)
- [ ] 2 deleted nodes not visible
- [ ] Total visible: 8 nodes (3 new + 3 modified + 2 unchanged)

---

## Phase 8: Error Handling & Edge Cases

### Test 8.1: Corrupt Timeline Data
**Objective:** Verify graceful handling of invalid timeline data.

**Steps:**
1. Create a diagram with timeline
2. Close Obsidian
3. Manually edit `.bac4` file - corrupt the timeline JSON:
   ```json
   "timeline": {
     "version": "1.0.0",
     "snapshots": "INVALID"
   }
   ```
4. Reopen Obsidian
5. Open the corrupted diagram

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Diagram opens (doesn't crash plugin)
- [ ] Error logged to console
- [ ] Timeline resets to initial state (1 snapshot)
- [ ] Nodes/edges load if still valid
- [ ] User can continue working

---

### Test 8.2: Missing Snapshot Reference
**Objective:** Verify handling when `currentSnapshotId` references non-existent snapshot.

**Steps:**
1. Create diagram with 2 snapshots
2. Close Obsidian
3. Edit file - change `currentSnapshotId` to invalid ID:
   ```json
   "currentSnapshotId": "snapshot-nonexistent-12345"
   ```
4. Reopen diagram

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Diagram loads
- [ ] Falls back to first snapshot in array
- [ ] Warning in console
- [ ] Timeline toolbar works normally

---

### Test 8.3: Snapshot with Empty Nodes Array
**Objective:** Verify empty snapshots are valid.

**Steps:**
1. Create new diagram (empty canvas)
2. Add snapshot: "Empty Baseline"
3. Add 5 nodes
4. Add snapshot: "With Nodes"
5. Switch between snapshots

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] "Empty Baseline" shows blank canvas
- [ ] "With Nodes" shows 5 nodes
- [ ] No errors in console
- [ ] Can add nodes to empty snapshot
