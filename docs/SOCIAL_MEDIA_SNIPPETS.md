### Tweet 1: Problem Statement
```
Spent 4 hours updating Visio diagrams last night for this morning's architecture review.

There has to be a better way.

Introducing BAC4: Git-native cloud architecture diagrams with AI generation. Free forever.

Create in 5 seconds what used to take 4 hours.

#SolutionArchitecture #CloudArchitecture
```

### Tweet 2: AI Generation Demo
```
"Create a Container diagram for an e-commerce platform with React frontend, Node.js API, PostgreSQL, Redis, and S3"

BAC4: *generates complete diagram in 5 seconds*

This is what 10x productivity looks like for solution architects.

#AI #CloudArchitecture
```

### Tweet 3: Git-Native Value
```
Your architecture diagrams should be:
‚úÖ Version controlled (git diff, not v2_final_FINAL.vsdx)
‚úÖ Diffable (see what actually changed)
‚úÖ Collaborative (pull requests, not email attachments)
‚úÖ Free (MIT license, not $1,500/year subscriptions)

BAC4 checks all the boxes.

#DevTools #EnterpriseArchitecture
```

### Tweet 4: Tool Comparison
```
Architecture diagramming tools:

Visio: $900-$1,800/year, no version control
Lucidchart: $540-$1,620/year, cloud-only
PowerPoint: Free with Office, not built for architecture
BAC4: $0/year, Git-native, AI-powered, cloud components built-in

The choice is obvious.

#SolutionArchitecture
```

### Tweet 5: ROI
```
BAC4 saves me 4 hours per month on architecture documentation.

That's 48 hours per year.

At $150/hour, that's $7,200 in value.

And it's free.

ROI: ‚àû

### LinkedIn Post 1: Full Story (Long-Form)
```
**The Architecture Documentation Tool I Wish Existed (So I Built It)**

After my 100th late night updating Visio diagrams, I realized something:

We're using tools designed for general-purpose diagramming to manage cloud architectures. It's like using Microsoft Word to write code.

So I built BAC4 - a purpose-built architecture management platform for solution architects.

**What makes it different?**

üé® Three ways to create diagrams:
‚Ä¢ Manual drag-and-drop (full control)
‚Ä¢ AI generation (describe in plain English ‚Üí get diagram in 5 seconds)
‚Ä¢ Conversational design with Claude Desktop (iterative refinement)

üìä Git-native architecture:
‚Ä¢ Every diagram is version-controlled JSON
‚Ä¢ Real diffs: see exactly what changed
‚Ä¢ Collaborate via pull requests, not email

‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud-first design:
‚Ä¢ Built-in AWS, Azure, GCP component libraries
‚Ä¢ Drag & drop Lambda, S3, DynamoDB
‚Ä¢ Professional diagrams in minutes, not hours

üîó Hierarchical navigation:
‚Ä¢ C4 Model: Context ‚Üí Container ‚Üí Component
‚Ä¢ Double-click to drill down
‚Ä¢ Never lose context

üí∞ Pricing: FREE
‚Ä¢ MIT license
‚Ä¢ No subscriptions
‚Ä¢ Optional AI generation: $0.01/diagram

**Real-world impact:**

Pre-sales proposals: 4 hours ‚Üí 30 minutes
Architecture reviews: 3 hours ‚Üí 1 hour
Team onboarding: 2-hour meetings ‚Üí self-service

That's 48+ hours saved per year. At $150/hour, that's $7,200 in value.

**Who's it for?**

If you're a solution architect, enterprise architect, or technical lead managing cloud architectures, this tool will change how you work.

Try it today: https://github.com/DavidROliverBA/bac4

Built with the BMAD Method in partnership with Claude Code.

### LinkedIn Post 2: Problem-Focused
```
**Stop me if this sounds familiar:**

It's 2 AM before a critical architecture review.

You're frantically updating Visio diagrams that haven't been touched in 6 months.

The AWS infrastructure changed 3 sprints ago, but the docs still show the old setup.

Someone saved over the editable version with a flattened PDF.

You're recreating everything from memory.

---

This was my life as a solution architect. Until I decided to fix it.

Introducing BAC4: Architecture management that actually works.

‚úÖ AI-powered generation (create diagrams in 5 seconds)
‚úÖ Git-native version control (real diffs, not v2_final_FINAL.vsdx)
‚úÖ Cloud component libraries (AWS, Azure, GCP built-in)
‚úÖ Hierarchical C4 model (drill down from Context ‚Üí Container ‚Üí Component)
‚úÖ Free forever (MIT license)

**The result?**
‚Ä¢ Pre-sales proposals: 4 hours ‚Üí 30 minutes
‚Ä¢ Architecture reviews: 3 hours ‚Üí 1 hour
‚Ä¢ 48+ hours saved per year = $7,200 value

If you're tired of fighting with diagramming tools, give BAC4 a try.

```
**Title:** I built a Git-native architecture diagramming tool with AI generation because I was tired of Visio

**Body:**

Hey architects,

I spent too many late nights updating Visio diagrams and decided there had to be a better way.

So I built BAC4 - an architecture management platform specifically for solution architects working in cloud environments.

**Key features:**
- Three creation methods: manual, AI generation, or conversational design with Claude
- Git-native (every diagram is version-controlled JSON)
- Cloud component libraries (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- C4 Model hierarchy (Context ‚Üí Container ‚Üí Component)
- Free forever (MIT license)

**What problem does it solve?**
Traditional tools (Visio, Lucidchart, PowerPoint) weren't built for cloud architecture. No version control, no cloud components, no AI generation. Just hours of manual work.

**Real impact:**
- Pre-sales proposals: 4 hours ‚Üí 30 minutes
- Architecture reviews: 3 hours ‚Üí 1 hour
- Team onboarding: Self-service instead of 2-hour walkthroughs

**Current status:** v0.7.0, production-ready, 100+ tests passing

It's an Obsidian plugin, so it integrates with your knowledge base (if you use Obsidian). If not, Obsidian is free and works on all platforms.

GitHub: https://github.com/DavidROliverBA/bac4

Would love feedback from the community!

**Tech stack:** TypeScript, React, React Flow, Anthropic API, MCP protocol
```

### r/CloudArchitecture
```
**Title:** Free tool for cloud architecture diagrams with AI generation and Git version control

## Hacker News

### HN Post
```
**Title:** BAC4 ‚Äì Git-native cloud architecture diagrams with AI generation

**URL:** https://github.com/DavidROliverBA/bac4

**Optional comment to post:**

Author here. Built this after spending one too many nights updating Visio diagrams.

The core insight: Architecture diagrams should be version-controlled code, not binary files or SaaS platform data.

Every .bac4 file is plain JSON. Git diffs show exactly what changed. Diagrams link to each other hierarchically (C4 Model). AI generates new diagrams in seconds.

It's an Obsidian plugin because I wanted my architecture docs integrated with my technical notes, not isolated in a separate tool.

Tech stack: TypeScript, React, React Flow, Anthropic API/MCP. MIT licensed.

Happy to answer questions!

**Body:**

Hey Obsidian community!

I'm excited to share **BAC4 (Business Architecture for C4)** - a plugin I built for managing cloud architecture diagrams inside Obsidian.

## The Problem

As a solution architect, I was tired of:
- Spending 4+ hours creating/updating diagrams in Visio
- No version control beyond "architecture_v2_final_FINAL.vsdx"
- Architecture docs scattered across tools (diagrams in Lucidchart, notes in Obsidian, ADRs in Confluence)
- Manual copying of cloud service icons from Google Images

## The Solution: BAC4

**Core Features:**
üé® Visual C4 diagram editor (Context, Container, Component levels)
ü§ñ AI-powered generation via Anthropic API or Claude Desktop MCP
‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud component libraries (AWS, Azure, GCP)
üîó Hierarchical navigation with drill-down
üì§ Export to PNG, JPEG, SVG
üìÅ Git-native JSON format (version control friendly)

**Three Ways to Create Diagrams:**
1. **Manual:** Drag & drop nodes, connect edges, customize

## Email Newsletter (If You Have One)

**Subject:** Introducing BAC4: Git-Native Cloud Architecture Diagrams

**Body:**

Hey [Name],

I've been working on something I'm excited to share.

After spending too many late nights updating Visio diagrams, I decided to build a better tool for solution architects.

**Introducing BAC4** - architecture management that actually works:

‚úÖ Create diagrams 10x faster with AI
‚úÖ Real version control with Git (not "v2_final_FINAL.vsdx")
‚úÖ Cloud components built-in (AWS, Azure, GCP)
‚úÖ Lives in your knowledge base (Obsidian)
‚úÖ Free forever (MIT license)

**What makes it different?**

You can create diagrams three ways:
1. Manual drag-and-drop
2. AI generation ("Create a Container diagram for..." ‚Üí diagram in 5 seconds)
3. Chat with Claude Desktop for complex systems

And it's Git-native. Every diagram is version-controlled JSON. See exactly what changed with `git diff`.

**Real impact:**
- Pre-sales proposals: 4 hours ‚Üí 30 minutes
- Architecture reviews: 3 hours ‚Üí 1 hour
- 48+ hours saved per year

**Try it:** https://github.com/DavidROliverBA/bac4

Download takes 2 minutes. First AI-generated diagram takes 5 minutes.

Let me know what you think!

Best,
David

P.S. It's open source (MIT license) and runs as an Obsidian plugin. If you don't use Obsidian yet, this might be a good reason to start.
