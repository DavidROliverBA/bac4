## üöÄ Upgrade Path

### From v2.3.0 ‚Üí v2.4.0

**Steps:**
1. Build new version: `npm run build`
2. Copy `main.js` to vault plugins folder
3. Copy `manifest.json` to vault plugins folder
4. Reload Obsidian (Cmd+R / Ctrl+R)

6. Try AI commands on existing diagrams

**No data migration needed** - AI features work with existing diagrams immediately.

---

## üìù Known Limitations

1. **AI Commands Require Open Diagram**
   - All AI commands require an active BAC4 canvas view
   - Open a .bac4 file first, then run commands

2. **Report Generation Location**
   - Reports created in `BAC4/` folder
   - Overwrites existing reports with same name

3. **No Live Validation**
   - Validation is on-demand, not automatic
   - Run commands manually after making changes

4. **Pattern Detection Accuracy**
   - Based on naming conventions and structure
   - May not detect all patterns
   - Confidence scores indicate certainty
