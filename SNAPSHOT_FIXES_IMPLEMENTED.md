## Fixes Implemented

### ‚úÖ FIX 1: Auto-Switch to New Snapshot After Creation

**Problem:** Creating a snapshot stayed on current view, requiring manual switch to see it

**Solution:** Modified snapshot creation to automatically switch to new snapshot

**Files Changed:**
1. `src/services/TimelineService.ts:75`
   - Changed `currentSnapshotId: currentTimeline.currentSnapshotId`
   - To: `currentSnapshotId: snapshot.id`

2. `src/ui/canvas-view.tsx:636-657`
   - Added logic to load new snapshot's state into canvas after creation
   - Canvas now shows new snapshot immediately

**Expected Behavior:**
```
1. User viewing "Current" snapshot (2 green nodes)
2. Clicks "+ Add Snapshot", enters label "Phase 1"
3. ‚úÖ NEW: Automatically switches to "Phase 1" view
4. ‚úÖ NEW: Timeline dropdown shows "Phase 1 ‚úèÔ∏è"
5. ‚úÖ NEW: Canvas still shows 2 green nodes (captured from Current)
```

### ‚úÖ FIX 2 & 3: Force Save to Disk When Switching Snapshots

**Problem:** Data loss when switching snapshots quickly (before 300ms auto-save completes)

**Root Cause:**
- Changes saved to v1 timeline (in-memory) ‚úì
- But NOT saved to disk ‚úó
- Auto-save race condition caused data loss

**Solution:** Implemented force save that writes to disk immediately before switching

**Files Changed:**

1. **Created `forceSaveSnapshot()` function**
   - `src/ui/canvas/hooks/useFileOperations.ts:78-215`
   - Cancels pending auto-save
   - Writes current canvas state to disk immediately
   - Uses same logic as auto-save but synchronous

2. **Updated auto-save to use timeout ref**
   - `src/ui/canvas/hooks/useFileOperations.ts:76, 236-238, 369-373`
   - Added `autoSaveTimeoutRef` to track timeout ID
   - Allows cancellation when force save runs

3. **Exposed forceSaveSnapshot via ref**
   - `src/ui/canvas/hooks/useFileOperations.ts:48, 70, 379-388`
   - Added `forceSaveRef` parameter to hook props
   - Stores function in ref for parent component access

4. **Updated handleSnapshotSwitch to call force save**
   - `src/ui/canvas-view.tsx:527-566`
   - Made function `async`
   - Calls `await forceSaveRef.current()` before switching
   - Ensures changes are on disk before loading new snapshot

5. **Added forceSaveRef in canvas-view**
   - `src/ui/canvas-view.tsx:137, 374`
   - Created ref to hold force save function
   - Passed to useFileOperations hook

**Expected Behavior:**
```
BEFORE FIX (data loss):
1. View "Phase 1", change color to blue
2. Immediately switch to "Current" (< 300ms)
3. ‚ùå Changes to Phase 1 LOST
4. Auto-save runs with "Current" data

AFTER FIX (data saved):
1. View "Phase 1", change color to blue
2. Immediately switch to "Current"
3. ‚úÖ Force save writes Phase 1 to disk first
4. ‚úÖ Then loads "Current" snapshot
5. ‚úÖ Switch back to Phase 1 ‚Üí blue color preserved!
```

## Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Auto-Switch on Snapshot Creation

**Steps:**
1. Open any BAC4 diagram (e.g., "New Market 10.bac4")
2. Add 2 nodes, make them green
3. Click "+ Add Snapshot" button
4. Enter label "Phase 1", click "Create Snapshot"

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ Timeline dropdown shows "Phase 1 ‚úèÔ∏è" (auto-switched)
- ‚úÖ Canvas shows 2 green nodes (captured from previous state)
- ‚úÖ No manual switch required

**How to Verify:**
- Check timeline dropdown - should show "Phase 1" selected
- Check breadcrumb - should show "Snapshot: Phase 1"

---

### Test 2: Color Changes Persist (Previously Broken)

**Steps:**
1. Open diagram with 2 green nodes on "Current" snapshot
2. Create snapshot "Phase 1" (auto-switches to it)
3. Change all node colors to blue
4. **Immediately** switch to "Current" (< 1 second)
5. Switch back to "Phase 1"

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ Phase 1 shows 2 BLUE nodes (changes saved)
- ‚úÖ Current shows 2 GREEN nodes (isolated)

**How to Verify:**
- Open browser console (Cmd+Option+I)
- Look for: `BAC4 v2.5.1: üíæ FORCE SAVE triggered`
- Look for: `BAC4 v2.5.1: ‚úÖ FORCE SAVE complete`

---

### Test 3: Add Nodes to Snapshot (Previously Broken)

**Steps:**
1. View "Phase 1" snapshot (2 nodes)
2. Add 3rd node
3. **Immediately** switch to "Current"
4. Close file (wait 4 seconds for auto-save)
5. Reopen file
6. Switch to "Phase 1"

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ Phase 1 shows 3 nodes (new node saved)
- ‚úÖ Current shows 2 nodes (isolated)

**How to Verify:**
- After reopening, check Phase 1 snapshot
- Should have 3 nodes, not 2

---

### Test 4: Rapid Snapshot Switching (Stress Test)

**Steps:**
1. Create 3 snapshots: "A", "B", "C"
2. In "A": make nodes red, wait 100ms
3. Switch to "B", make nodes blue, wait 100ms
4. Switch to "C", make nodes green, wait 100ms
5. Rapidly switch between all 3 (A ‚Üí B ‚Üí C ‚Üí A ‚Üí B ‚Üí C)
6. Close file
7. Reopen file

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ A: red nodes
- ‚úÖ B: blue nodes
- ‚úÖ C: green nodes
- ‚úÖ No data loss, no contamination

**How to Verify:**
- Console shows force saves for each switch
- No timeout errors
- All snapshots retain correct colors

---

### Test 5: File Close/Reopen (Integration Test)

**Steps:**
1. Create snapshot "Phase 1" with 2 green nodes
2. Add 3rd node, change all to blue
3. Close file immediately (Cmd+W)
4. Reopen file

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ File opens to "Phase 1" (last viewed snapshot)
- ‚úÖ Shows 3 blue nodes (changes saved)

**How to Verify:**
- Check which snapshot is active on file open
- Verify node count and colors match last edit

## Known Issues / Limitations

### Not Yet Implemented

**GAP 4: Smart Node Deletion**
- **Status:** Not implemented (lower priority)
- **Impact:** When deleting snapshots, orphaned nodes remain in `.bac4` file
- **Workaround:** None currently, but doesn't affect functionality
- **Planned:** Phase 2 (future update)
